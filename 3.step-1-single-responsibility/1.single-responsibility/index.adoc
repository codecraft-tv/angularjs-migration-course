= Single Responsibility

In this lecture we will discuss the Single Responsibility rule for Angular applications and see how we can implement the same in our contacts application.

== The Angular Style Guide

The https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md[Angular 1 Style Guide] is an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions and structuring of Angular applications.

The style guide consists of an extensive list of best practices and conventions for application development. You can implement as many or as little of this as you want; Our focus will be on understanding the Single Responsibility rule and how it can be implemented into our application.

== What is Single Responsibility?

The Single Responsibility rule defines _one component per file_ where each file is recommended to be less than 400 lines of code. This promotes,

* Easier unit testing and mocking
* Code readability and easier maintenance
* Less bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

== An Example
Lets take a look at the `controller.js` file in our contacts application and see how we can apply the Single Responsibility rule to break it down into separate component files.

.controller.js
[source,javascript]
----
angular
  .module("codecraft")
  .controller("PersonCreateController", function(
    $scope,
    $state,
    ContactService
  ) {
    $scope.contacts = ContactService;
    $scope.person = {};

    $scope.save = function() {
      console.log("createContact");
      $scope.contacts.createContact($scope.person).then(function() {
        $state.go("list");
      });
    };
  })
  .controller("PersonEditController", function(
    $scope,
    $stateParams,
    $state,
    ContactService
  ) {
    $scope.contacts = ContactService;
    $scope.person = $scope.contacts.getPerson($stateParams.email);

    $scope.save = function() {
      $scope.contacts.updateContact($scope.person).then(function() {
        $state.go("list");
      });
    };

    $scope.remove = function() {
      $scope.contacts.removeContact($scope.person).then(function() {
        $state.go("list");
      });
    };
  })
  .controller("PersonListController", function($scope, ContactService) {
    $scope.contacts = ContactService;
  })
  .controller("SearchController", function($scope, ContactService) {
    $scope.contacts = ContactService;

    $scope.loadMore = function() {
      $scope.contacts.loadMore();
    };
  });
----

As you can see, the `controller.js` file contains 4 separate controllers in the same file. This violates the single responsibility rule. To fix this, we need to move each of these controllers into separate files.

=== Applying the Single Responsibility Rule

* *Step 1:* Create a folder called `controllers` inside the `app` folder.
* *Step 2:* Create a file named `person-create.controller.js` inside the `controllers` folder.
* *Step 3:* Move the `PersonCreateController` code block from the `controllers.js` file to the newly created `person-create-controller.js` file.

.person-create.controller.js
[source,javascript]
----
angular
  .module("codecraft")
  .controller("PersonCreateController", function(
    $scope,
    $state,
    ContactService
  ) {
    $scope.contacts = ContactService;
    $scope.person = {};

    $scope.save = function() {
      console.log("createContact");
      $scope.contacts.createContact($scope.person).then(function() {
        $state.go("list");
      });
    };
  });
----
* *Step 4:* Repeat the same procedure for the remaining 3 controllers so that we have 4 separate controller files for each controller. Your `controllers` folder should look similar to Figure 1.

* *Step 5:* Go to the `index.html` file and replace the following code:

[source,html]
----
<script src="app/controllers.js"></script>
----

with:

[source,html]
----
<script src="app/controllers/person-create.controller.js"></script>
<script src="app/controllers/person-list.controller.js"></script>
<script src="app/controllers/person-edit.controller.js"></script>
<script src="app/controllers/search.controller.js"></script>
----

to import the newly added controller files in to the application.

* *Step 6:* Re-build your application and visit it on `http://localhost:5000` to make sure everything works as expected.

== Exercise

Follow the same procedure to breakdown the `directives`, `filters` and `services` into individual component files. Once you are done, check your code against the `step-2` branch for verification! Your file directory should look similar to Figure 2:

== In summary..

* The Angular Style Guide consists of an extensive list of best practices and conventions for application development.

* The first rule of the style guide is the Single Responsibility rule which defines one component per file.

* Benefits of following the single responsibility rule ranges from easier unit testing and mocking to better code readability and maintenance.

* All of this contributes towards a much, much easier process of migration!
